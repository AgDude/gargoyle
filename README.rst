Gargoyle is a platform built on top of Django which allows you to switch functionality of your application on and off based on conditions.

It was originally created by `Disqus <https://github.com/disqus/gargoyle>`_, but due to the inactivity we at YPlan have taken over maintenance on this fork.

Requirements
------------

Tested with all combinations of:

* Python: 2.7
* Django: 1.7, 1.8

Install
-------

Install it with ``pip`` (or ``easy_install``):

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install gargoyle-yplan

Make sure you ``pip uninstall gargoyle`` first if you're upgrading from the original to this fork - the packages clash.

Documentation
-------------

The documentation is available at `Read The Docs <http://gargoyle-yplan.readthedocs.org/>`_.
